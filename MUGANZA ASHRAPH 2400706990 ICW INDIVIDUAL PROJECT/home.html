                <p>
                    Hydropower is a renewable energy source that harnesses the power of flowing
                    water to generate electricity. It is one of the oldest and most established
                    forms of renewable energy, providing a significant portion of the world's
                    electricity.
                    <br />
                    It generates electricity by using the kinetic energy of flowing water to
                    turn turbines, which then convert this energy into electrical power.

                <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    Solar energy is harnessed from the sun's rays and converted into electricity
                    or heat. It is one of the most abundant and widely used forms of renewable
                    energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) panels, are used to capture
                    sunlight and convert it into electricity. This clean and sustainable energy
                    source can be used for various applications, from powering homes to
                    fueling electric vehicles.

                <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    Wind energy is generated by converting the kinetic energy from wind into
                    mechanical power or electricity. It is a clean and renewable source of
                    energy that has gained significant popularity in recent years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wind turbines are used to capture the wind's energy and convert it into
                    electricity. These turbines can be installed onshore or offshore, and they
                    play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating
                    climate change.

                <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
                <p>
                    Nuclear energy is produced through the process of nuclear fission, where
                    the nucleus of an atom is split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a
                    significant amount of energy in the form of heat. This heat is then used to
                    generate electricity in nuclear power plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nuclear energy is a low-carbon energy source that can provide a stable and
                    reliable supply of electricity. However, it also comes with challenges such
                    as radioactive waste management and safety concerns.
